# Data and Products of the Global Deterministic Wave Prediction System (GDWPS) 

The Global Deterministic Wave Prediction System (GDWPS) produces wave forecasts using the third generation spectral wave model WaveWatch III®. The model is forced by the 10 meters winds from the Global Deterministic Prediction System. In addition, a sea ice forecast from the Global Ice-Ocean Prediction System (GIOPS) is used by the model to dampen or suppress wave growth in areas covered respectively with 25% to 75% and more than 75% ice.

The WW3 (Tolman and the WAVEWATCH III® Development Group 2014) is a third generation spectral wave prediction model that solves the evolution of the energy balance equation for the 2-D wave energy spectrum without any prior assumptions on the shape of the spectrum. The WW3 model has been implemented by a growing number of national operational forecasting centres over the last several years.

## Access

### How to access the data

These data are available on the data server services [MSC Datamart](../../msc-datamart/readme_en.md) and the web services [MSC GeoMet](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md) respectively :
