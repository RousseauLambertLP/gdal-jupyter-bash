# Data and Products of the Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System FireWork

Smoke from wildfires in forests and grasslands can be a major source of air pollution for Canadians. The fine particles in the smoke can be a serious risk to health, particularly for children, seniors and those with heart or lung disease. Because smoke may be carried thousands of kilometres downwind, distant locations can be affected almost as severely as areas close to the fire. To help Canadians be better prepared, wildfire smoke forecast maps are available through the Government of Canada’s FireWork system. FireWork is an air quality prediction system that indicates how smoke from wildfires is expected to move across North America over the next 48 hours.
