# Data and products of the Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis

The Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (RDPA) produces a best estimate of the amount of precipitation that occurred over recent past periods of 6 or 24 hours. The estimate integrates data from in situ precipitation gauge measurements, weather radar and numerical weather prediction models. Geographic coverage is North America (Canada, United States and Mexico). Data is available at horizontal resolution of 10 km. Data is only available for the surface level. Analysis data is made available four times a day for 6h intervals and once a day for the 24h interval. A preliminary estimate is available approximately 1h after the end of the accumulation period, and revised 6h after in order to assimilate gauge data arriving later.

## Access

### How to access the data

These data are available on the data server services MSC Datamart and the web services MSC GeoMet respectively:

* [Current data and archives available via geospatial web services GeoMet-Weather](readme_rdpa-geomet_en.md)
* [Current GRIB2 data available on the MSC Datamart](readme_rdpa-datamart_en.md) 

An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is available.

### Licence

The [end-user licence for Environment and Climate Change Canada's data servers](../../licence/readme_en.md) specifies the conditions of use of these data.

### Metadata

The [metadata of the Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis are available on the Open Government Portal](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/fdd3446a-dc20-5bad-9755-0855e3ec9b19)
