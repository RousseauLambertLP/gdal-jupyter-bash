# Data and Products of the Regional Ice Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS)

The Regional Ice Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS) provides 48 hr ice and ocean forecasts four times per day on a 1/12° resolution grid (3-8 km). RIOPS is initialized using analyses from the [Global Ice-Ocean Prediction System (GIOPS)](../nwp_giops/readme_giops_en.md). Atmospheric fluxes for 48 hr forecasts are calculated using fields from the [Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS)](../nwp_rdps/readme_rdps_en.md).
