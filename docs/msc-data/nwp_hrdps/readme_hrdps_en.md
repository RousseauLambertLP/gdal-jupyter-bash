# Data and Products of the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System

The High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS) carries out physics calculations to arrive at deterministic predictions of atmospheric elements from the current day out to 48 hours into the future. Atmospheric elements include temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed and direction, humidity and others. This product contains raw numerical results of these calculations. Geographical coverage of the system is most of Canada. Data is available over specific areas in the MSC Datamart and the whole coverage is available in the MSC GeoMet web services. Data is available at a horizontal resolution of 2.5 km. Data is available for 28 vertical levels. Predictions are performed up to four times a day.


## Access

### How to access the data

These data are available on the data server services [MSC Datamart](../../msc-datamart/readme_en.md) and the web services [MSC GeoMet](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md) respectively:

* [GRIB2 data available on the MSC Datamart](readme_hrdps-datamart_en.md) 
* [Experimental 1km West GRIB2 data available on the MSC testing data repository DD-Alpha](readme_hrdps-datamart-alpha_en.md) 
* [Data available via geospatial web services GeoMet-Weather](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md)

An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is available.

### Licence

The [end-user licence for Environment and Climate Change Canada's data servers](../../licence/readme_en.md) specifies the conditions of use of these data.


### Metadata

The [metadata of the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System are available on the Open Government Portal](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/5b401fa0-6c29-57f0-b3d5-749f301d829d)
