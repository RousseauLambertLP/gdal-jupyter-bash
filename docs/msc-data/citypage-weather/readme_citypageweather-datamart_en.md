# Weather forecast data by city in XML format

This page describes the XML data of the [weather forecasts by city](readme_citypageweather_en.md) available in the MSC Datamart.

The XML files are updated hourly at a minimum, but can be updated earlier with issue of special weather warnings, watches and amendments.

## Data location

MSC Datamart data can be [automatically retrieved with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](../../msc-datamart/amqp_en.md) as soon as they become available. An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is also available.

The data is available via the HTTP protocol. It is possible to access it with a standard browser. In this case, we obtain a list of links giving access to a XML file.

* The weather forecast data by city are available according to this hierarchy :

  [https://dd.weather.gc.ca/citypage_weather/xml/{XX}](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/citypage_weather/xml)
  
  where __XX__ is a 2 letter provincial or territorial code indicating the area covered by the forecasts. 

  The code is one of the 13 following values :

    * AB (Alberta)
