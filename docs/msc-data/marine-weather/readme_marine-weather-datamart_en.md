# Data of the marine weather forecasts

This page describes the data of the [marine weather](readme_marine-weather_en.md) forecasts available on the MSC Datamart.

The XML files contain the weather forecast, marine weather warnings (warning and watch), ice alerts and the end of season announcement. They are updated two to four times a day, or more often in the case of amendments, marine weather warnings (alert or watch) or ice warnings.

The [Environment and Climate Change Canada's guide to the marine forecast](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/general-marine-weather-information/publications/guide-forecasts.html) includes information on the issuing time of forecasts, time period covered by forecast, determination of forecast regions, forecast time period terminology, information included in the forecast, and forecast revision.

__Notes__:

* The marine XML files do not include ice forecast information, but do include [ice alert information](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/ice-forecasts-observations/latest-conditions/products-guides/iceberg-bulletin-overview.html#warnings).

* Ice forecast information can be found on the [Environment and Climate Change Canada web site](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/ice-forecasts-observations.html) and on the [Canadian Ice Service](https://www.canada.ca/fr/environnement-changement-climatique/services/previsions-observations-glaces/conditions-glaces-plus-recentes.html) web site.
