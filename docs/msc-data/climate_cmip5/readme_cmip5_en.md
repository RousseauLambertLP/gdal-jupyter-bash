# Data and products of the climate scenarios datasets based on an ensemble of global climate model projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)  

The Global climate model scenarios dataset is based on an ensemble of global climate model projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are provided. Multi-model ensembles of modelled output (actual value) and projected change (anomaly) are available for historical simulations and three emission scenarios at a 1x1 degree grid resolution. Projected changes are expressed as anomalies with respect to the reference period of 1986-2005. A range of percentiles across the multi-model ensembles are available for download.

## Access

### How to access the data

These data are available on the data server services [MSC Datamart](../../msc-datamart/readme_en.md) and the web services [MSC GeoMet](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md) respectively :

* [NetCDF data available on the MSC Datamart](readme_cmip5-datamart_en.md) 
* [Data available via geospatial web services GeoMet-Climate](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md)

An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is available.

### Licence

The [end-user licence for Environment and Climate Change Canada's data servers](../../licence/readme_en.md) specifies the conditions of use of these data.
