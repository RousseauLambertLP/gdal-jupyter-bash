# Regional Deterministic Wave Prediction System (RDWPS) Data in GRIB2 Format

This page describes the data of the [Regional Deterministic Wave Prediction System](readme_rdwps_en.md).

## Great Lakes

The [Regional Deterministic Wave Prediction System (RDWPS)](readme_rdwps_en.md) produces wave forecasts for the Great Lakes using the third generation spectral wave model WaveWatch III®. The model is forced by the 10 meters winds from the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS). A sea ice analysis is used by the model to dampen or suppress wave growth in areas covered respectively with 25% to 75% and more than 75% ice.

The WW3 (Tolman and the WAVEWATCH III® Development Group 2014) is a third generation spectral wave prediction model that solves the evolution of the energy balance equation for the 2-D wave energy spectrum without any prior assumptions on the shape of the spectrum. The WW3 model has been implemented by a growing number of national operational forecasting centers over the last several years. 

This system includes four domains:

* Lake Superior
* Lake Huron-Michigan
* Lake Erie
* Lake Ontario

All four domains have a spatial resolution of 1 km (0.0090 deg x 0.0124 deg).

## Gulf of Saint Lawrence

The [Regional Deterministic Wave Prediction System (RDWPS)](readme_rdwps_en.md) produces wave forecasts for the Gulf of Saint Lawrence using the third generation spectral wave model WAM. The model is forced by the 10 meters winds from the Regional Deterministic Prediction System. In addition, an analysis of sea ice is used by the model to suppress wave growth in areas covered with greater than 50% ice.

WAM (WAve Model) (WAMDI Group 1988, Komen et al. 1994) is a third generation spectral wave prediction model that solves the evolution of the energy balance equation for the 2-D wave energy spectrum without any prior assumptions on the shape of the spectrum. The WAM model has been operational in the international community since the early nineties after a long period of development under the WAMDIG (WAve Model Development and Implementation Group).

## Data location

MSC Datamart data can be [automatically retrieved with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](../../msc-datamart/amqp_en.md) as soon as they become available. An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is also available.

The data is available using the HTTP protocol and resides in a directory that is plainly accessible to a web browser. Visiting that directory with an interactive browser will yield a raw listing of links, each link being a downloadable GRIB2 file.

The data can be accessed at the following URLs :
