# Data and Products of the Global Deterministic Prediction System

The Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS) performs physical calculations to produce deterministic forecasts of atmospheric elements from the present day to 10 days in the future. Elements of the atmosphere include temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed and direction, and humidity. This product contains the raw numerical results of these calculations. The geographical coverage is global. The horizontal spatial resolution of the data is 25 and 15 km. Data is available for 28 vertical levels. The forecasts are carried out twice a day.

## Access

### How to access the data

These data are available on the data server services [MSC Datamart](../../msc-datamart/readme_en.md) and the web services [MSC GeoMet](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md) respectively :

* [GRIB2 data available on the MSC Datamart](readme_gdps-datamart_en.md) 
* [Data available via geospatial web services GeoMet-Weather](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md)

An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is available.


### Licence

The [end-user licence for Environment and Climate Change Canada's data servers](../../licence/readme_en.md) specifies the conditions of use of these data.
