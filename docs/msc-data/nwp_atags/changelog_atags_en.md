### A new autoTAF Automated Guidance System (aTAGS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC)

On Wednesday, September 7th, 2016, the Canadian Meteorological Centre will implement a new system called the autoTAF Automated Guidance System also known as aTAGS. This system executes hourly to generate aviation sensitive meteorological fields such as probability and intensity of thunderstorms, cloud ceiling height, and visibility, that will ultimately feed a Canadian autoTAF system currently under development. The autoTAF system will provide automated first-guess TAF (Terminal Aerodrome Forecast) forecasts to the two Canadian Meteorological Aviation Centres (CMACs).
