# Global Ensemble Prediction System (GEPS) Data in GRIB2 Format

This page describes the [Global Ensemble Prediction System](readme_geps_en.md) data available in GRIB2 format.

## Data location

MSC Datamart data can be [automatically retrieved with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](../../msc-datamart/amqp_en.md) as soon as they become available. An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is also available.

The data is available using the HTTP protocol and resides in a directory that is plainly accessible to a web browser. Visiting that directory with an interactive browser will yield a raw listing of links, each link being a downloadable GRIB2 file.

The data can be accessed at the following URLs :

* [https://dd.weather.gc.ca/ensemble/geps/grib2/{TYPE}/{HH}/{hhh}/](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/ensemble/geps/grib2)

where :

* __TYPE__ : String indicating individual members direct model outputs (not processed) or probabilistic products created from all members [raw, products]
* __HH__ : Model run start, in UTC [00,12]
* __hhh__ : Forecast hour [000, 003, …, 192, 198, 204, ..., 378, 384] and [000, 003, …, 192, 198, 204, ..., 762, 768] each Thursday at 000UTC

The files contain probability products by member counting above or below different thresholds, percentiles, means, medians and standard deviations. Note that products and thresholds are defined in the file metadata.

For example, for the total precipitation accumulated over a 12-hour period (TPRATE-Accum-12h), we find the following products:

* Probability above 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100 and 150 mm
* Minimum (0 percentile), maximum (100th percentile), median (50th percentile), standard deviation and mean
* Additional percentiles: 10,25,75 and 90
