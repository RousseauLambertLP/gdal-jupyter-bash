# Data and Products of the Global Ensemble Prediction System (GEPS)

The Global Ensemble Prediction System (GEPS) carries out physics calculations to arrive at probabilistic predictions of atmospheric elements from the current day out to 16 days into the future (up to 32 days once a week on Thursdays at 00UTC). The GEPS produces different outlooks (scenarios) to estimate the forecast uncertainties due the nonlinear (chaotic) behaviour of the atmosphere. The probabilistic predictions are based on an ensemble of 20 scenarios that differ in their initial conditions, choice of physics parametrization as well as stochastic perturbations (physical tendencies and kinetic energy). A control member that is not perturbed is also available. Weather elements include temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed and direction, humidity and others. This product contains raw numerical results of these calculations. Geographical coverage is global. Data is available at a horizontal resolution of 1 degree (about 111 km at equator). Data is available for 11 vertical levels. Predictions are performed twice a day.

## Access

### How to access the data

These data are available on the data server services [MSC Datamart](../../msc-datamart/readme_en.md) and the web services [MSC GeoMet](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md) respectively :

* [GRIB2 data available on the MSC Datamart](readme_geps-datamart_en.md) 
* [Data available via geospatial web services GeoMet-Weather](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md)

An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is available.

### Licence

The [end-user licence for Environment and Climate Change Canada's data servers](../../licence/readme_en.md) specifies the conditions of use of these data.
