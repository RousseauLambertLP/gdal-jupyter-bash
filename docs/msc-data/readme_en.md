# Meteorological Service of Canada open data

The Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) provides up-to-date information on past, present and future weather conditions, climate, water and environmental information over Canada and the world.

* Environment and Climate Change Canada’s Meteorological Service is the country’s authoritative source for weather, water, ice and climate information and Canada’s official source for severe weather warnings
* The MSC provides weather forecasts and warnings 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. MSC also provides federal department, agencies and other levels of government with information to support emergency preparedness and response to events such as storms, floods, wildfires and other weather-related emergencies
* Timely and accurate information on changing weather, water, ice and climate conditions helps Canadians make informed decisions for their health, safety, and economic prosperity
* Environment and Climate Change Canada’s weather, water, and climate information support sound economic decision making for Canada’s key business sectors. These include construction, manufacturing, energy production, agriculture, transportation, forestry, mining, retail, finance, and tourism
