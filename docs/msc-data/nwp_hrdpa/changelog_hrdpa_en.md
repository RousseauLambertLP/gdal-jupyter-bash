# Chronology of changes to the High Resolution Deterministic Precipitation Analysis system (CaPA-HRDPA)

## Tuesday January 21, 2020

### Upgrade to Version 4.7.0 of the CaPA-HRDPA adapted to the New High Performance Computing Infrastructure.

See details [at this link](../changelog_multisystems_en.md)

## Wednesday July 3, 2019

### Upgrade to version 4.6.0 of the High Resolution Deterministic Precipitation Analysis system (CaPA-HRDPA) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC)

On Wednesday July 3rd 2019, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) will upgrade the High Resolution Deterministic Precipication Analysis system (CaPA-HRDPA) to version 4.6.0.

Changes are summarized as follows:

* [HRDPS v5.1.0](../nwp_hrdps/changelog_hrdps_en.md) now provides the trial field instead of HRDPS v5.0.0.

A copy of the official note announcing the implementation of these changes [is available at this link](http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2019/07/03/NOCN03_CWAO_031240___43184).


## Tuesday September 18, 2018

### Upgrade to version 4.5.0 of the High Resolution Deterministic Precipitation Analysis System (CaPA-HRDPA) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC)

On Tuesday, September 18, 2018, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) will upgrade its Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis systems (CaPA-HRDPA (2.5km)) to version 4.5.0.

The changes included in this upgrade are summarized as follows:

* The trial fields for these precipitaion analyses are generated from the new version of the system implemented on September 18, 2018:
    * CaPA-HRDPA now builds its trial fields from [HRDPS v5.0.0](../nwp_hrdps/changelog_hrdps_en.md)
* Assimilation of the observations from the CoCoRaHS network. (CaPA-HRDPA)
* New 24h analysis valid at 06h00 UTC in line with the climatological day. (CaPA-HRDPA)

A copy of the official note announcing this implementation is available at this location:

* [CaPA-HRDPA official announcement](http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2018/09/17/NOCN03_CWAO_171416___54417)

## Friday March 2, 2018

### Implementation of the High Resolution Deterministic Precipitation Analysis System (CaPA-HRDPA Version 4.1.0) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC)

On Friday, March 2nd 2018, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Meteorological Service of Canada's Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis System by adding a new configuration of higher resolution analyses (CaPA-HRDPA). These new analyses at 2.5km horizontal resolution are in addition to those analyses already produced in operational mode at 15km resolution since 2011, and at 10km resolution since October 2012.
