## Thursday June 11, 2015

### Upgrade to the Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System (RAQDPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC)

On Thursday, June 11 2015, the Canadian Meteorological Centre implemented a new emissions data set for the operational Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System (RAQDPS). The new emissions set is based on the 2010 Canadian Inventory/2011 USA Inventory, updating from the 2006 Canadian Inventory/2005 USA Inventory.

## Tuesday November 18th 2014

### Minor Upgrade to the Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System (RAQDPS) version 1.5.3 at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Tuesday November 18th 2014, starting with the 1200 UTC run the Meteorological Service of Canada's Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System (RAQDPS). The version of the system is changed from 1.5.2 to 1.5.3. The update include the following changes:

1. The system now feeds from the Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS) version 4.0.0

2. The GEM model employed by the RAQDPS changes from version 3.3.8.1 to 3.3.8.2.

## Tuesday February 26, 2013

### Update to the Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System (RAQDPS - version 1.5.1) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Tuesday, February 26, 2013, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will implement version 1.5.1 of the Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System (RAQDPS). This version contains three bug fixes in the chemistry component which bring significant improvements to the operational air quality forecast system.

During the summer of 2012, three bugs were discovered in the RAQDPS, all of which had been present since operational implementation in 2009. The bugs mainly impacted wet removal of chemical species by convective precipitation (both rain-out and below-cloud scavenging); and vertical mixing particularly in stable atmospheric conditions.

RAQDPS-1.5.1 has been tested extensively over the summer and winter of 2012. Objective evaluation scores indicate an improvement in RAQDPS-1.5.1 forecasts when compared to those of version 1.5.0 for the three main pollutants: ozone (O3), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The most significant improvement with RAQDPS-1.5.1 is observed for winter PM2.5 concentrations, especially for the daily maximum values. The new system represents better the observed values with an important reduction of the peak daily concentration in cases where the RAQDPS had over-forecast the PM2.5.

Categorical scores such as: percentage correct, critical success index, and false alarm ratio show an improvement with RAQDPS-1.5.1 in both summer and winter seasons for all three pollutants: O3, NO2 and PM2.5.

For approximately 90% of stations, UMOS-AQ performs similarly during both cold and warm seasons when connected to RAQDPS-1.5.0 and RAQDPS-1.5.1. For the majority of the remaining stations, UMOS-AQ performance is improved with RAQDPS-1.5.1.

There will be no changes to product availability as a result of this implementation.

A copy of the official note describing these changes and the verification work leading up to this implementation is available [here](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/doc/genots/2013/02/26/NOCN03_CWAO_262210___00308).

## Wednesday October 3 2012

### The Canadian Meteorological Centre Upgrades the Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System (RAQDPS) to version 1.5

On Wednesday October 3 2012, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will implement version 1.5.0 of the Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System (RAQDPS). This version of RAQDPS replaces version 1.4.6 which was also formerly known as GEM-MACH15 which had been in service since November 2009.

Improvements to the air quality forecast system are provided as a result of changes in grid resolution (from 15 to 10 km) and to the vertical grid spacing, an updated version of the GEM model, and an improved set of emissions files.

Please note that this update is made necessary as a result of major upgrades to the Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS) which provides initial and lateral boundary conditions to the RAQDPS. For details on the RDPS upgrade please refer to the information [at this link](/../nwp_rdps/changelog_rdps_en.md).

Products from this system are expected to be available a few minutes later than they were previously, due to the slightly longer execution time caused by the model's higher resolution.

A copy of the official note describing these changes is available [at this link here](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/doc/genots/2012/10/02/NOCN03_CWAO_022002___00095).

A technical note with details on changes including version 1.5.0 and 1.5.1 is available [at this link here](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/CMOI/product_guide/docs/lib/op_systems/doc_opchanges/technote_raqdps_20121003_e.pdf).

## Thursday December 22, 2011

### The Canadian Meteorological Centre implements a correction for GEM-MACH15

Starting with the 12 UTC run of December 22 2011, an updated binary was installed in the GEM-MACH15 system to better process humidity and cloud information in the very upper levels of the model's atmosphere.

With this correction the GEM-MACH15 system is now versiuon 1.4.5.
