### Major Upgrade to the Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean-Ice Forecast System - Gulf of St-Lawrence  at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Tuesday November 18th 2014, starting with the 1200 UTC run the Meteorological Service of Canada's Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will update the operational regional Marine Prediction system (RMPS-GSL) and the associated Regional Deterministic Prediction System - Coupled in the Gulf of St-Lawrence (RDPS-CGSL). The RMPS-GSL version will be updated to 6.0.0 and the RDPS-CGSL will be 3.0.0. Here are the major changes:

* The frequency of analysis and forecast runs will increase from run per day (0000 UTC) to four runs per day : 0000, 0006, 1200 and 1800 UTC
* The operational ocean model will change from Saucier et al model (MoGSL) to the Nucleus for European Modeling of the Ocean (NEMO) Model.
* The GEM model will be upgraded from version 4.0.7 to version 4.6.0

A copy of the official note announcing the implementation of these changes is available at [this link](http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2014/11/14/NOCN03_CWAO_141852___01271).

Technical notes with more details on these changes for both components are available here:

## Wednesday October 3 2012

### The Canadian Meteorological Centre Upgrades the Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean-Ice Forecast System for the Gulf St-Lawrence

On Wednesday October 3 2012, starting with the 0000 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will adjust the Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean_Ice Forecast System in order for it to use a 10km grid. This change is to ensure this system stays on a same grid as the newly installed RDPS system which is now using a 10km grid.
