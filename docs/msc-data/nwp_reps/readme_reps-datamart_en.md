# Regional Ensemble Prediction System (REPS) Data in GRIB2 Format

This page describes the [Regional Ensemble Prediction System](readme_reps_en.md) data available in GRIB2 format.

## Data location

MSC Datamart data can be [automatically retrieved with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](../../msc-datamart/amqp_en.md) as soon as they become available. An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is also available.

The data is available using the HTTP protocol and resides in a directory that is plainly accessible to a web browser. Visiting that directory with an interactive browser will yield a raw listing of links, each link being a downloadable GRIB2 file. 

The data can be accessed at the following URLs:

* [https://dd.weather.gc.ca/ensemble/reps/15km/grib2/{EnsembleDataType}/{HH}/{hhh}](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/ensemble/reps/15km/grib2)

where :

* __EnsembleDataType__ : Can be raw for individual members direct model output or prob for probabilistic products created from all members.
* __HH__ : Forecast run hour in UTC
* __hhh__ : Forecast time

A 24-hour history is stored in this directory.

## Technical specification of the grid

![REPS grid](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmos/public_doc/msc-data/nwp_reps/grille_reps.png)

Values given to the parameters of the stereographic polar grid:

| Parameter | Value |
| ------ | ------ |
| ni | 600 |
| nj | 610 | 
| resolution at 60° N | 10 km |
| coordinates of the first grid point | 19.3206° N  141.5411° W | 
| grid orientation (with respect to j axis) | -110.0° |

## File name nomenclature 

NOTE: ALL HOURS ARE IN UTC.

The files have the following nomenclature:

CMC-reps-srpe-EnsembleDataType_Variable_LevelType_Level_Resolution_YYYYMMDDHH_Phhh_FileContent.grib2

## About the No-data mask

A mask called "No-data" has been added to our GRIB2 encoding process in order to better represent the areas where data are unavailable. This mask only concerns a few grid points with no data, always the same ones, located at the edge of the domain. Note that this mask has no negative effect on the product quality.
