# Data and products of statistically downscaled climate scenarios datasets based on an ensemble of global climate model projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)  

The Statistically downscaled climate scenarios dataset provides projected changes in temperature and precipitation, with respect to the reference period of 1986-2005, for three emission scenarios, RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5, at a 10km resolution. Downscaled data are based on global climate model projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The median projected changes across the downscaled multi-model ensemble are shown.

## Access

### How to access the data

These data are available on the data server services [MSC Datamart](../../msc-datamart/readme_en.md) and the web services [MSC GeoMet](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md) respectively :

* [NetCDF data available on the MSC Datamart](readme_dcs-datamart_en.md) 
* [Data available via geospatial web services GeoMet-Climate](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md)

An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is available.

### Licence

The [end-user licence for Environment and Climate Change Canada's data servers](../../licence/readme_en.md) specifies the conditions of use of these data.
