# MSC METEOHACK Hackathon 2019

This page is dedicated to the 1st METEOHACK hackathon of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) held in Montreal, at the [Phi Centre](https://phi-centre.com/), and online across Canada, from July 8 to 10, 2019, with the assistance of the Corporate Services and Finance Branch, and Shared Services Canada.

This hackathon challenged 150 innovators in 21 teams across the country and 4 teams within Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). The aim was to demonstrate, within 48 hours, the potential of MSC's open data in the Earth sciences, through **4 main themes** :

* __The Earth and Us__ 

*Combine Earth science and meteorological data with sociological and economic information to generate new insights and perspectives on human interactions with the environment.*

* __New audiences__

*Find new applications for a diverse audience that generally does not care about Earth science and meteorological data: young audiences, students, non-experts and diverse socio-cultural communities.

* __Caution! Imminent danger!__

*Analyze Earth science and meteorological data to help monitor natural disasters and phenomena associated with health risks and assess their impacts on life and property.*

* __An artistic representation of the Earth__

*Artistically interpret Earth science and weather data to create beautiful data visualizations, virtual reality experiences, music or unique works of art*

During this event, **guest speakers** from various backgrounds came to talk about areas of activity surrounding the proposed themes and presented information and open data sources that could be used as part of the programming marathon:

* [Tornado data in Canada](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmos/meteohack/presentations/hackathon_guest-speakers/SILLS_CMOS-IUGG-2019_Hackthon_final.pptx) - David Sills de Western Engineering
